### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I am Nitesh Narang a front-end-developer I like to spend most of my time in learning and creating the Web Applications using React, JavaScript , Html and CSS.

**Here is some work you should visit:**
* [Animated Portfolio Website](https://nitproject4.netlify.app/)
* [Stylish Landing Page](https://nitproject3.netlify.app/)

### If you have any work for me(_drop a message_):
* [LinkedIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nitesh-narang-72511295/)
* [Telegram]

Apart from coding, I do read alot. Here are some of my all time favourite books:
* Deep Work by Cal Newport.
* Atomic Habits by James Clear.
* Zero to One by Peter Thiel.

##### I am very curious to know about how the human minds work and how can we hack it for our advantage.

##### My Target is to enhance my skills by working on more Open-source Projects and eager to learn from the like-minded people. That's all folks I want to say about me here.
