### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I am Nitesh Narang, a full-stack developer. I like to spend most of my time learning and creating Web Applications using MERN stack and, for styling the app, I have used Tailwind and SCSS.

**Here is my portfolio site:**
* [Nitesh Narang](https://niteshnarang.netlify.app/)

### If you have work for me (_drop a message_):
* [LinkedIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nitesh-narang-72511295/)

Apart from coding, I do read a lot. Here are some of my all-time favorite books:
* Deep Work by Cal Newport.
* Atomic Habits by James Clear.
* Zero to One by Peter Thiel.

I am curious to know how human minds work and how we can hack it for our advantage.
My Target is to enhance my skills by working on more Open-source Projects and eager to learn from like-minded people.
